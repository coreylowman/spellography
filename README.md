A study in the art of writing spells

## Vision

Want to be able to draw spells in a VR enviroment.

A spell is just like writing a word or sentence on a piece of paper, except instead of on a 2d surface, it will be written in the air.

A single spell is made up of a few parts, each of which is sort of like a word in a sentence:

1. Cast time (adverb) - how long will you cast this spell for?
    1. Charge: hold the spell for as long as you want - it gets stronger the longer it is charged.
    1. Instant cast: instantly cast the spell. The spell will have reduced effects.
    1. Channel: Cast the spell continuously until you stop. The effect over the duration will be greater than an instant cast, but not as strong as if you had charged for the same duration. 
1. Modifier - what will the spell affect?
    1. Health: positively (for allies) or negatively (for enemies) affect the health of the target
    1. Location [direction]: move the target to a different location
    1. Potency: positively or negatively affect a casters spell power
    1. Sanity: positively or negatively affect a person's ability to see reality
1. Target (noun) - who will this spell be affecting?
    1. Yourself
    1. Direction [speed]
    1. Area [radius]
1. Effect activation time
    1. Instant
    1. Over time [time]
    1. Delayed [time]
    1. Trap: Activates when someone walks over it

Here are some sample spells:

1. Teleport - Instantly cast a move on yourself that happens instantly
1. Force pull - instantly cast a move in a direction that happens after a few seconds
1. Rain of Ice - Channel a damaging spell in an area causing instant damage
1. Rain of Fire - Channel a damaging spell in an area causing damage over time
1. Bolt of healing - Charge a healing spell in a direction causing healing over time
1. Curse of the Dead - Instantly cast a spell affecting sanity in a direction causing delayed insanity
1. Trap of realism - Instantly cast a sanity spell in an area causing a trap sanity
